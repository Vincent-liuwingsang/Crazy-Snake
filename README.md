# Crazy-Snake
This is the classical snake game with a twist.

How to play:
Eat the green token but advoid the pink ones.
Don't crash into the wall.
The game will become harder as you proceed.

Control:
1) Arrow Keys for movement
2) Spacebar for restart
3) Key "i" turns the random movement of dangerous tokens on/off.
4) Keys "1","2","3" control the speed of the snake and vibration.
